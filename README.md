# KitchenParty2

Created for the Labrador Creative Arts Festival 2015 to demonstrate performance systems and simple electronics to school children.

A visualization project using midi network communication and Capacitive touch sensors (mapped to keyboard) to trigger lighting, audio,
and projection effects when different instruments (made out of kitchen appliances) were played.

Part 2 features a video game played using two of the musical instruments. Projectiles are fired by the drum and dodged by the piano.

Original project interfaced with QLab v3 and Mainstage 3 and QLC+ using midi triggering. Images were forced to a secondary 1024x768 wide-throw projector.
